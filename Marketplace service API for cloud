To create a marketplace service fulfilling the specified requirements using AWS services, follow these steps:

### 1. Design and Implementation Overview

#### Components and AWS Services Used:
- **API Layer:** Amazon API Gateway
- **Backend Database:** Amazon RDS (MySQL, for example)
- **Email Notification:** Amazon SES (Simple Email Service)
- **Web Frontend:** Hosted on Amazon S3 and distributed via Amazon CloudFront
- **Monitoring:** Amazon CloudWatch
- **IAM Management:** AWS IAM

### 2. Implementation Steps

#### Step 1: Set Up Database (Amazon RDS)

1. **Create an Amazon RDS Instance:**
   - Choose a database engine (e.g., MySQL, PostgreSQL).
   - Configure instance size, storage, and networking options.
   - Set up security group to allow access from API Gateway and other necessary components.

#### Step 2: Implement API (Amazon API Gateway)

1. **Create API Gateway:**
   - Go to Amazon API Gateway in AWS Management Console.
   - Create a new API.
   - Define resources (`/products`) and methods (`GET` and `POST`).

2. **Configure `GET` Method:**
   - Implement integration to fetch products from the database.
   - Set up necessary mapping templates and security (e.g., API key, IAM roles).

3. **Configure `POST` Method:**
   - Implement integration to insert new products into the database.
   - Use Lambda function (Node.js, Python, etc.) to handle the POST request.
   - Trigger an email notification using Amazon SES after successful product insertion.

#### Step 3: Set Up Email Notification (Amazon SES)

1. **Verify and Configure Email Address:**
   - Verify the sender and recipient email addresses in Amazon SES console.
   - Set up an email template for notifications.

2. **Trigger Email from Lambda Function:**
   - In the Lambda function handling the POST method, integrate SES SDK to send email notifications.

#### Step 4: Develop Web Frontend (Amazon S3 and CloudFront)

1. **Create Static Website in Amazon S3:**
   - Upload HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files for the marketplace frontend.
   - Configure S3 bucket policy to allow public access to these files.

2. **Distribute Website via CloudFront:**
   - Create a new CloudFront distribution.
   - Set the S3 bucket as the origin.
   - Configure caching behavior and SSL settings as needed.

#### Step 5: Set Up Monitoring and Alerts (Amazon CloudWatch)

1. **Create CloudWatch Dashboard:**
   - Go to Amazon CloudWatch in AWS Management Console.
   - Create a new dashboard to monitor API Gateway, Lambda function metrics, RDS instance metrics, and CloudFront metrics.

2. **Set Alarms for Excess CPU Usage:**
   - Define CloudWatch alarms for API Gateway latency, Lambda function errors, RDS CPU utilization, and CloudFront errors.
   - Configure actions (e.g., send SNS notifications, trigger Lambda functions) for alarm states.

#### Step 6: IAM Management

1. **Create IAM Users and Roles:**
   - Create separate IAM users for development, database administrators, and SRE teams.
   - Assign appropriate policies and permissions:
     - Developers: API Gateway permissions, CloudWatch read-only access.
     - Database Administrators: Amazon RDS full access.
     - SRE Teams: CloudWatch dashboard and alarm management permissions.

2. **Implement Least Privilege Principle:**
   - Use IAM policies with least privilege to restrict access to specific AWS resources based on roles and responsibilities.

### Conclusion

By following these steps, you'll have a robust marketplace service deployed on AWS, leveraging various AWS services for scalability, reliability, and security. This architecture ensures seamless integration of API endpoints, database management, email notifications, web frontend, monitoring, and access control using IAM. Adjust configurations and settings based on specific requirements and best practices to optimize performance and security.
