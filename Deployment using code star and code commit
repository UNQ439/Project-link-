### Manual Approach: Deploying ASP.NET Core Application to IIS

1. **Create ASP.NET Core Web Application:**
   - Develop an ASP.NET Core web application using Visual Studio or Visual Studio Code.

2. **Deploy to IIS:**
   - Publish the ASP.NET Core application to a local folder or directly to IIS using Visual Studio's publish wizard or command-line tools.

3. **Set Title of Web Application:**
   - Ensure the application displays "Welcome to Manual Deployment" as the title.

4. **Apply Code Change:**
   - Modify the source code to change the title to "Applying DevOps to Speed Up Application Delivery".
   - Republish or redeploy the application to reflect the code change in IIS.

### Automated Approach: Using AWS CodeStar for CI/CD Pipeline

1. **Create ASP.NET Core Web Application with AWS CodeStar:**
   - Use AWS CodeStar to create a new ASP.NET Core web application project integrated with AWS services.

2. **Code Repository - AWS CodeCommit:**
   - Store the application code securely in AWS CodeCommit, AWS's managed Git repository service.

3. **Automated Build - AWS CodeBuild:**
   - Configure AWS CodeBuild to automatically build the ASP.NET Core application upon code commit.
   - Use build specifications (buildspec.yml) to define build steps and dependencies.

   Example `buildspec.yml`:
   ```yaml
   version: 0.2
   phases:
     install:
       runtime-versions:
         dotnet: 3.1
     build:
       commands:
         - dotnet restore
         - dotnet build -c Release
         - dotnet publish -c Release -o ./publish_output
   artifacts:
     files:
       - '**/*'
     base-directory: './publish_output'
   ```

4. **Automated Deployment - AWS CodeDeploy:**
   - Set up AWS CodeDeploy to deploy the built ASP.NET Core application package (from CodeBuild output) to an AWS EC2 instance.
   - Define deployment configurations and hooks to manage deployment lifecycle and validation.

### Benefits and Impact of Moving from Manual to Automated CI/CD Pipeline

#### Benefits:

1. **Speed and Efficiency:**
   - **Manual Approach:** Deployment and code changes are time-consuming and error-prone.
   - **Automated Approach:** Streamlined CI/CD pipeline accelerates build, test, and deployment processes, reducing time to market.

2. **Consistency and Reliability:**
   - **Manual Approach:** Deployment configurations may vary, leading to inconsistencies.
   - **Automated Approach:** Standardized deployment processes ensure consistent and reliable deployments across environments.

3. **Scalability:**
   - **Manual Approach:** Scaling deployment manually is complex and resource-intensive.
   - **Automated Approach:** Easily scale deployments with automated tools like AWS CodeDeploy, supporting continuous growth and demand.

4. **Visibility and Control:**
   - **Automated Approach:** Detailed logs, monitoring, and rollback capabilities in AWS CodePipeline and related services provide visibility and control over the deployment pipeline.

#### Impact:

1. **Enhanced Development Agility:**
   - Developers can focus more on writing code and less on deployment tasks, fostering agility and innovation.

2. **Reduced Risk and Improved Quality:**
   - Automated testing and deployment reduce human errors, improving application quality and reliability.

3. **Cost Efficiency:**
   - Efficient use of resources and reduced downtime translate to cost savings in operations and maintenance.

4. **Compliance and Security:**
   - Automated pipelines facilitate adherence to compliance standards and security best practices through consistent deployment processes.

In conclusion, moving from a manual deployment approach to a fully automated CI/CD pipeline with AWS CodeStar brings significant advantages in terms of speed, efficiency, consistency, and scalability. It transforms software delivery into a streamlined, repeatable process that enhances agility, reduces risk, improves quality, and ultimately supports continuous improvement and innovation in application development and deployment.
