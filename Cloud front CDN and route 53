To complete the assignment of hosting a static website on AWS using S3, integrating it with CloudFront CDN, and setting up a custom domain with Route 53, follow these steps:

### 1. Configure Static Website Hosting on Amazon S3

1. **Create an S3 Bucket:**
   - Log in to your AWS Management Console.
   - Go to S3 service.
   - Click on **Create bucket**.
   - Enter a unique bucket name (e.g., `example.com`) and choose a region.
   - Keep all other settings as default and click **Create bucket**.

2. **Upload Website Files:**
   - Select the bucket you just created.
   - Click on **Upload**.
   - Upload your HTML, CSS, JavaScript files, and any other assets (images, etc.) that make up your static website.
   - Make sure to set the appropriate permissions (`Public` or `Bucket Policy` allowing public access) for your files.

3. **Enable Static Website Hosting:**
   - In the S3 bucket properties, navigate to the **Static website hosting** card.
   - Choose **Use this bucket to host a website**.
   - Set the `Index document` (e.g., `index.html`) and optionally, the `Error document`.
   - Save the changes.

4. **Verify Website Hosting:**
   - Access the endpoint URL provided in the Static website hosting card to verify your website is accessible.

### 2. Configure Static Website with CloudFront Distribution

1. **Create a CloudFront Distribution:**
   - Go to CloudFront service in AWS Management Console.
   - Click on **Create Distribution**.
   - Choose **Web** distribution type.
   - In the `Origin Domain Name`, select the S3 bucket endpoint created earlier.
   - Configure other settings like caching behavior, origin settings, etc., as per your requirements.
   - Click **Create Distribution**.

2. **Wait for CloudFront Distribution Deployment:**
   - It may take several minutes for the CloudFront distribution to deploy fully. Wait until the status changes to `Deployed`.

3. **Access Website via CloudFront URL:**
   - Once deployed, you'll get a CloudFront domain name (e.g., `d12345abcdef.cloudfront.net`).
   - Access your website using this CloudFront domain name to verify it's working through CloudFront.

### 3. Integrating Route 53 with CloudFront CDN

1. **Create a Route 53 Hosted Zone:**
   - Go to Route 53 service in AWS Management Console.
   - Click on **Hosted zones** and then **Create Hosted Zone**.
   - Enter your domain name (e.g., `example.com`) and click **Create**.

2. **Create a Record Set for Your Domain:**
   - Inside your hosted zone, click on **Create Record Set**.
   - Leave the `Name` blank to indicate the root domain (`example.com`).
   - Choose `Alias` as the type and select your CloudFront distribution from the dropdown list.
   - Save the record set.

3. **Update DNS Nameservers (if using a new domain):**
   - If you are using a new domain registered outside AWS, update the domain's DNS nameservers to the ones provided by Route 53 in the hosted zone.

4. **Verify Custom Domain:**
   - Wait for DNS changes to propagate (this can take some time depending on TTL settings).
   - Once propagated, access your website using your custom domain name (e.g., `http://www.example.com`) to verify it's working with CloudFront.

### Final Checks

- Ensure all permissions are correctly set in S3 and CloudFront to allow public access to your website content.
- Test the website's performance and verify that it's accessible via both the CloudFront domain and your custom domain.

By following these steps, you'll successfully host your static website on AWS S3, integrate it with CloudFront CDN for improved performance, and use Route 53 to map a custom domain name to your CloudFront distribution. This setup ensures your website is secure, scalable, and performs well globally.
